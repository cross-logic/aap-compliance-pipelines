# AAP Compliance Pipelines

A Backstage-based compliance management prototype for Ansible Automation Platform. Provides self-service compliance scanning, results analysis, and selective remediation for RHEL infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or 22
- Corepack enabled (`corepack enable`)
- Yarn 4.x (installed via Corepack)
- For live mode: access to an AAP 2.6+ Controller instance

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cross-logic/aap-compliance-pipelines.git
cd aap-compliance-pipelines/backstage-app

# Install dependencies and set up hooks
./install-deps

# Start the dev server (mock mode — no AAP needed)
yarn start
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend at `http://localhost:7007`.

By default the plugin runs in **mock mode** with sample compliance data — no AAP connection required. This is ideal for demos and UI development.

## Data Modes: Mock vs Live

The plugin supports two data modes controlled by `compliance.dataSource` in `app-config.yaml`:

### Mock Mode (default)

Mock mode uses built-in sample data. No AAP instance needed.

```yaml
# app-config.yaml
compliance:
  dataSource: mock
```

This is the default. The plugin shows:
- 20 hosts across 3 groups (web-prod, db-prod, app-prod)
- 12 STIG rules with realistic pass/fail distributions
- Interactive remediation profile builder with host-level detail
- All UI features fully functional with sample data

**Use mock mode for:** demos, UI development, UX reviews, sharing with stakeholders.

### Live Mode (connected to AAP)

Live mode connects to a real AAP Controller instance and runs actual compliance scans.

#### Step 1: Create your `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your AAP connection details:

```bash
# Required — AAP Controller connection
AAP_HOST=https://your-aap-controller.example.com
AAP_API_TOKEN=your-api-token-here

# Required for OAuth login (if using AAP authentication)
AAP_AUTH_CLIENT_ID=your-oauth-client-id
AAP_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your-oauth-client-secret

# Optional — auto-generated if empty
BACKEND_SECRET=
AUTH_SIGNING_KEY=

# Optional — GitHub integration for catalog
GITHUB_INTEGRATION_TOKEN=
```

> **How to get an AAP API token:** Log into your AAP Controller → Administration → Applications → Create a Personal Access Token. Give it `write` scope.

> **How to get OAuth credentials:** Log into your AAP Controller → Administration → Applications → Create a new OAuth2 Application. Set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/rhaap/handler/frame`. Note the client ID and secret.

#### Step 2: Switch to live mode

Edit `app-config.yaml` and change the data source:

```yaml
compliance:
  dataSource: live    # Change from 'mock' to 'live'
```

#### Step 3: Handle self-signed certificates (if needed)

If your AAP instance uses self-signed certificates, ensure this is set in `app-config.yaml`:

```yaml
ansible:
  rhaap:
    baseUrl: ${AAP_HOST}
    checkSSL: false     # Set to true in production with valid certs
```

#### Step 4: Restart the server

```bash
# Kill any running instance
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Start with live connection
yarn start
```

The plugin will now:
- Launch real compliance scan workflows on your AAP Controller
- Display findings from actual OpenSCAP scans
- Execute remediation playbooks against real targets
- Store results in the Backstage PostgreSQL database

### Switching Back to Mock Mode

To return to mock mode (e.g., for a demo), simply change `app-config.yaml`:

```yaml
compliance:
  dataSource: mock    # Change back to 'mock'
```

Restart the server. No `.env` changes needed — mock mode ignores AAP credentials.

### Pre-commit Hooks

Husky runs `lint-staged` on every commit, which applies ESLint and Prettier to staged `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mjs`, and `.cjs` files.

## AAP Lab Setup (for contributors)

If you have access to an AAP lab environment and want to set up the compliance workflow:

### 1. Create compliance resources in Controller

The collection includes playbooks to seed AAP with compliance resources:

- Organization: `compliance-prototype`
- Inventory with target RHEL 9 hosts
- Machine credential for SSH access
- Project pointing to this repo
- Job templates: gather-facts, evaluate, remediate
- Workflow: Gather → Evaluate → Remediate

### 2. Required Controller resources

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Organization | Isolates compliance resources |
| Inventory | Target hosts for scanning |
| Machine Credential | SSH access to targets |
| Project (git) | Points to this repo for playbooks |
| Job Templates (3) | Gather facts, evaluate rules, remediate findings |
| Workflow Template | Chains the 3 JTs into a pipeline |

### 3. Verified on lab

The pipeline has been validated end-to-end on AAP 2.6:
- `compliance_gather`: collected 703 packages, 235 services, SSH config, SELinux status from a RHEL 9 host via SSH (agentless)
- `compliance_evaluate`: evaluated 20 STIG rules — 8 pass, 12 fail
- Full workflow: Gather → Evaluate → Remediate completed successfully

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin shows mock data even after switching to live mode

Make sure you:
1. Created `.env` with valid `AAP_HOST` and `AAP_API_TOKEN`
2. Changed `compliance.dataSource` to `live` in `app-config.yaml`
3. Killed the old server (`lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`) and restarted with `yarn start`

### AAP connection errors in live mode

- Verify `AAP_HOST` is reachable: `curl -sk https://your-aap-host/api/v2/ping/`
- Check the API token is valid: `curl -sk -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" https://your-aap-host/api/v2/me/`
- If using self-signed certs, ensure `checkSSL: false` in app-config.yaml

### `yarn start` fails with module errors

Make sure you are using Node.js 20 or 22 (`node --version`). Run `./install-deps` to reinstall.

### `corepack` not found

Corepack ships with Node.js 16.10+. Run `corepack enable` to activate it.

### Pre-commit hook not running

Run `yarn prepare` to reinstall Husky hooks, or run `./install-deps`.
