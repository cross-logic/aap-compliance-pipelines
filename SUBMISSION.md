# Compliance Pipelines: Downstream Submission Guide

This document describes how to submit the compliance pipelines feature from this standalone prototype repo (`aap-compliance-pipelines`) to the downstream Ansible Portal repo (`ansible/ansible-rhdh-plugins`).

## Prerequisites

Before submitting to the downstream repo, ensure the following are complete:

1. **Jira ticket created**: An ANSTRAT feature ticket must exist for the compliance pipelines feature, linked to the appropriate parent Outcome (recommended: ANSTRAT-1670, Initiative 3: Strategic Domain Content)
2. **Spec review passed**: The spec at `specs/compliance-pipelines/spec.md` must be reviewed and approved by the Portal team. Run the quality checklist at `specs/compliance-pipelines/checklists/requirements.md` before submitting
3. **Architecture approval**: The cartridge model (user-facing: "compliance profile"), Gateway-only API routing, and Backstage PostgreSQL persistence approach must be approved via an ADR in the downstream repo
4. **Prototype validation**: Core workflows (compliance profile registration, scan launch, findings review, profile builder) must be demonstrated in the prototype environment
5. **Downstream branch created**: A feature branch in `ansible/ansible-rhdh-plugins` following the naming convention (e.g., `NNN-compliance-pipelines`)

## File Mapping

### Spec artifacts (this repo to downstream)

| This Repo | Downstream Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `specs/compliance-pipelines/spec.md` | `specs/NNN-compliance-pipelines/spec.md` | Update NNN to the assigned feature number |
| `specs/compliance-pipelines/plan.md` | `specs/NNN-compliance-pipelines/plan.md` | Update research paths to downstream relative paths |
| `specs/compliance-pipelines/checklists/requirements.md` | `specs/NNN-compliance-pipelines/checklists/requirements.md` | No changes needed |

### Plugin code (this repo to upstream submodule)

| This Repo | Downstream Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `backstage-app/plugins/compliance/` | `ansible-backstage-plugins/plugins/compliance/` | Frontend plugin — copy `src/`, `package.json` |
| `backstage-app/plugins/compliance-backend/` | `ansible-backstage-plugins/plugins/compliance-backend/` | Backend plugin — copy `src/`, `package.json`, migrations |
| `backstage-app/plugins/compliance-common/` | `ansible-backstage-plugins/plugins/compliance-common/` | Common types — copy `src/`, `package.json` |

### Documentation (this repo to downstream)

| This Repo | Downstream Location | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture decision records | `docs/adrs/NNN-compliance-*.md` | Create ADRs in downstream format (not yet written in this repo) |
| Research documents | `docs/research/NNN-compliance-*.md` | Adapt prototype research for downstream audience |

### Files that stay in this repo only

| File | Reason |
|---|---|
| `content/` | Ansible compliance content (collections, EE definitions) — ships separately |
| `collections/` | Ansible collection source — managed in its own repo or content pipeline |
| `scripts/` | Dev helper scripts specific to the prototype environment |
| `review/` | Internal review materials |
| `SUBMISSION.md` | This file — submission process documentation |
| `README.md` | Prototype-specific README |

## Step-by-Step Submission Process

### Step 1: Prepare the downstream branch

```bash
cd ansible-rhdh-plugins
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b NNN-compliance-pipelines
```

### Step 2: Create spec directory and copy artifacts

```bash
# Create the spec directory structure
mkdir -p specs/NNN-compliance-pipelines/checklists

# Copy spec artifacts (update paths and feature numbers in the files)
cp <path-to-this-repo>/specs/compliance-pipelines/spec.md \
   specs/NNN-compliance-pipelines/spec.md

cp <path-to-this-repo>/specs/compliance-pipelines/plan.md \
   specs/NNN-compliance-pipelines/plan.md

cp <path-to-this-repo>/specs/compliance-pipelines/checklists/requirements.md \
   specs/NNN-compliance-pipelines/checklists/requirements.md
```

### Step 3: Update spec file references

After copying, update the following in the spec and plan files:
- Feature branch name: update to `NNN-compliance-pipelines`
- Research links: update relative paths to match downstream `docs/research/` structure
- Remove any references to prototype-specific paths or infrastructure

### Step 4: Copy plugin code to the upstream submodule

```bash
cd ansible-backstage-plugins

# Create a feature branch in the upstream submodule
git checkout -b feat/compliance-pipelines

# Copy the three plugin packages
cp -r <path-to-this-repo>/backstage-app/plugins/compliance plugins/compliance
cp -r <path-to-this-repo>/backstage-app/plugins/compliance-backend plugins/compliance-backend
cp -r <path-to-this-repo>/backstage-app/plugins/compliance-common plugins/compliance-common

# Verify package.json files have correct names and dependencies
# Frontend: @redhat/backstage-plugin-compliance
# Backend:  @redhat/backstage-plugin-compliance-backend
# Common:   @redhat/backstage-plugin-compliance-common
```

### Step 5: Adapt code for downstream conventions

The prototype code may need adjustments:
- **Package naming**: Ensure packages follow the `@redhat/backstage-plugin-*` naming convention
- **Import paths**: Update any prototype-specific import paths to match the upstream monorepo structure
- **Config schema**: Ensure `config.d.ts` follows the downstream pattern (see existing plugins)
- **Dynamic plugin exports**: Add `alpha.ts` or dynamic plugin entry point if required by the downstream packaging
- **Tests**: Ensure tests pass in the upstream CI environment (`yarn test`, `yarn tsc`, `yarn lint`)

### Step 6: Create ADRs in downstream format

Write architecture decision records in `docs/adrs/` covering:
- ADR: Cartridge model (compliance profile) for pluggable scanner registration
- ADR: Gateway-only API routing (no direct Controller access)
- ADR: Backstage PostgreSQL for compliance data persistence
- ADR: CaC content consumption model (consume, don't author)
- ADR: Dynamic host grouping for remediation at scale

### Step 7: Create research documents

Adapt prototype research for the downstream `docs/research/` directory:
- Competitor analysis (Puppet SCE, Chef Compliance positioning)
- ComplianceAsCode content packaging approach
- Two-track scanning architecture rationale

### Step 8: Submit PRs

Two PRs are needed:

1. **Upstream PR** (code): PR to `ansible/ansible-backstage-plugins` from the submodule feature branch
   ```bash
   cd ansible-backstage-plugins
   gh pr create --repo ansible/ansible-backstage-plugins \
     --title "feat: compliance pipelines plugin" \
     --body "Adds compliance scanning, findings review, and remediation profile builder plugins"
   ```

2. **Downstream PR** (specs + docs): PR to `ansible/ansible-rhdh-plugins` from the feature branch
   ```bash
   cd ansible-rhdh-plugins
   gh pr create --repo ansible/ansible-rhdh-plugins \
     --title "spec: compliance pipelines feature" \
     --body "Adds spec, plan, and checklists for compliance pipelines feature"
   ```

### Step 9: Review and iterate

- Spec PR goes through speckit review process (`/speckit.review`)
- Code PR goes through standard upstream code review
- After both PRs merge, update the submodule pointer in the downstream repo

## Content Guidelines Reminder

Before submitting, verify all files comply with these rules:
- No passwords, tokens, API keys, or certificates (use `<placeholder>` or `<changeme>`)
- No real hostnames, IP addresses, or internal URLs (use `https://aap.example.com`)
- No employee names (use role titles: "Platform engineer", "Security officer")
- No customer names or deployment details
- Jira ticket IDs are acceptable; verbatim proprietary descriptions are not

## Downstream Speckit Workflow

Once the spec is in the downstream repo, the full speckit workflow applies:

```bash
/speckit.clarify specs/NNN-compliance-pipelines    # Find gaps
/speckit.plan specs/NNN-compliance-pipelines        # Refine plan
/speckit.tasks specs/NNN-compliance-pipelines       # Generate task breakdown
/speckit.adr specs/NNN-compliance-pipelines         # Create ADRs
/speckit.implement specs/NNN-compliance-pipelines   # Write code to submodule
/speckit.review specs/NNN-compliance-pipelines      # Quality review
```
