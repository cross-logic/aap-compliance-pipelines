## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Admin Registers a Compliance Cartridge (Priority: P1)

Before compliance scanning can begin, a platform administrator must register a "cartridge" — a mapping between a compliance profile (e.g., RHEL 9 DISA STIG), the Execution Environment that contains the scanner tooling and remediation content, and the AAP workflow template that orchestrates the scan-evaluate-remediate pipeline. Without this registration, the portal has no knowledge of what compliance standards are available or how to invoke them.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational configuration step. No cartridge registration means no scan profiles available, no scan launches possible, and no compliance functionality of any kind. Every other user story depends on at least one cartridge being registered.

**Independent Test**: Log in as a platform administrator, navigate to Compliance > Settings, register a new cartridge by selecting an EE, mapping it to a workflow template, and assigning a compliance profile name. Verify the cartridge appears in the profile browser and is available for scan launches.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a portal with the compliance plugin installed but no cartridges registered, **When** an admin navigates to Compliance > Settings, **Then** they see an empty state with instructions to register their first compliance cartridge and a "Register Cartridge" button
2. **Given** the cartridge registration form, **When** the admin selects an Execution Environment from a dropdown populated via the AAP Gateway API, maps it to a workflow template, and provides a display name and compliance standard identifier (e.g., `rhel9-stig-v2r8`), **Then** the cartridge is persisted to the compliance database and appears in the cartridge list
3. **Given** a registered cartridge, **When** the admin views the cartridge details, **Then** they see the EE name, workflow template name, compliance standard, creation date, and a status indicator showing whether the EE and workflow template are still accessible via the AAP Gateway
4. **Given** one or more registered cartridges, **When** any user navigates to the compliance profile browser, **Then** the registered profiles appear as selectable options for launching scans

---

### User Story 2 - Admin Launches a Compliance Scan from the Portal (Priority: P1)

Platform administrators need to initiate compliance scans against target infrastructure directly from the portal without requiring AAP Controller expertise or CLI access. The scan must invoke the correct AAP workflow (gather, evaluate) using the EE and content specified by the selected cartridge, targeting hosts specified by the administrator.

**Why this priority**: Scanning is the entry point for the entire compliance pipeline. Without the ability to launch scans from the portal, users must fall back to the Controller UI or CLI, eliminating the value of the portal integration entirely.

**Independent Test**: Select a registered compliance profile, choose target hosts from an inventory, launch a scan, and verify that the corresponding AAP workflow job is created and executes against the selected hosts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** at least one registered cartridge, **When** the admin clicks "Launch Scan" from the compliance dashboard, **Then** they see a scan configuration form with fields for: compliance profile (dropdown of registered cartridges), target inventory or host pattern, and optional scan parameters
2. **Given** a completed scan configuration form, **When** the admin clicks "Start Scan", **Then** the portal invokes the mapped AAP workflow template via the Gateway API with the appropriate EE, inventory, and extra variables, and displays a progress indicator linking to the active workflow job
3. **Given** a scan is in progress, **When** the admin views the compliance dashboard, **Then** they see the active scan with real-time status (pending, running, completed, failed) pulled from the AAP Gateway API job status endpoint
4. **Given** a scan completes successfully, **When** the admin views the scan results, **Then** parsed findings are stored in the compliance database with per-host, per-rule detail and the scan appears in the scan history list

---

### User Story 3 - Security Officer Reviews Scan Findings with Host-Level Detail (Priority: P1)

Security officers and compliance auditors need to review scan findings at both the rule level and the host level. A single STIG rule may pass on most hosts but fail on a few — the officer needs to see exactly which hosts failed, what the actual non-compliant values are, and how those values compare to the expected baseline. This granularity is essential for making informed remediation decisions.

**Why this priority**: Compliance review is the critical decision-making step between scanning and remediation. Without host-level detail, administrators cannot distinguish between a rule that failed on all 500 hosts versus one that failed on 2 outlier hosts — leading to either over-remediation (unnecessary risk) or under-remediation (compliance gaps).

**Independent Test**: After a completed scan against 5+ hosts, navigate to the findings view, verify that each finding shows per-host pass/fail counts, expand a failing finding to see individual host results with actual values, and confirm that severity categorization (CAT I/II/III) is correctly displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a completed scan with findings, **When** a security officer navigates to the scan results page, **Then** they see findings organized by severity (CAT I / CAT II / CAT III) with summary counts showing total rules checked, passed, failed, and not applicable
2. **Given** the findings list, **When** the officer views a specific finding, **Then** they see the rule ID, title, description, severity category, pass/fail counts per host (e.g., "18/20 pass, 2/20 fail"), and the expected baseline value
3. **Given** a finding with mixed host results, **When** the officer expands the host detail view, **Then** they see each host listed with its compliance status (pass/fail/error/not-applicable) and the actual observed value on that host (e.g., "host-2: TMOUT=300, expected: 600")
4. **Given** the findings view, **When** the officer filters by severity category or compliance status (pass/fail), **Then** the findings list updates to show only matching results and the summary counts reflect the filtered set
5. **Given** a finding that failed on a small subset of hosts, **When** the officer views the host detail, **Then** the portal displays a homogeneity advisory suggesting the outlier hosts may belong to a different inventory or require a separate remediation profile

---

### User Story 4 - Admin Builds a Remediation Profile with Selective Rule Toggles (Priority: P1)

After reviewing scan findings, platform administrators need to build a remediation profile that specifies exactly which failing rules to remediate, which hosts to target, and what parameter values to apply. Not all failing rules should be remediated — some may have business justifications for non-compliance, and some parameter values may need to differ from the benchmark default. The remediation profile captures these institutional decisions.

**Why this priority**: This is the core differentiator of the compliance pipeline. Competitors (Puppet SCE, Chef Compliance) offer all-or-nothing remediation. The ability to selectively toggle individual rules, override parameter values, and choose between "remediate failed only" versus "standardize all hosts" is the key UX innovation that justifies building this as a portal feature rather than using raw Ansible playbooks.

**Independent Test**: From scan findings, toggle individual rules on/off for remediation, override a parameter value on one rule, select "remediate failed hosts only" for another, and verify the resulting remediation profile accurately reflects these selections when previewed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a completed scan with findings, **When** the admin clicks "Build Remediation Profile", **Then** they see a profile builder showing all failing rules with toggles to include/exclude each rule from remediation, defaulting to all rules included
2. **Given** the profile builder, **When** the admin toggles a rule off, **Then** that rule is excluded from the remediation plan and visually marked as skipped with an optional text field for the justification
3. **Given** a rule included in remediation, **When** the admin clicks the rule detail, **Then** they see options for: remediation scope ("Failed hosts only" or "All hosts — standardize"), parameter value override (pre-filled with the benchmark default, editable), and a preview of which hosts will be affected
4. **Given** a profile with mixed selections (some rules on, some off, some with parameter overrides), **When** the admin clicks "Preview Plan", **Then** they see a summary showing the total number of rules to remediate, total hosts affected, and a matrix of rule-by-host actions that will be taken
5. **Given** a completed remediation profile, **When** the admin reviews the execution plan, **Then** the plan uses dynamic host grouping (hosts grouped by remediation need) rather than individual per-host-per-rule jobs, demonstrating scalable execution architecture

---

### User Story 5 - Admin Executes Remediation Against Selected Hosts (Priority: P2)

After building and reviewing a remediation profile, the administrator needs to execute the remediation against the targeted hosts. Execution must use the AAP workflow engine with appropriate job parameters derived from the profile, including `--limit` for host targeting, `--tags` for selective rule application, and `--extra-vars` for parameter overrides.

**Why this priority**: Execution is essential for completing the compliance loop, but it is logically dependent on the profile builder (P1). The remediation execution workflow already exists in AAP — the portal's job is to translate profile decisions into the correct workflow invocation parameters.

**Independent Test**: Build a remediation profile with selective rules and parameter overrides, execute it, verify the correct AAP workflow job is launched with the appropriate limit, tags, and extra variables, and confirm a verification re-scan is triggered after remediation completes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a completed remediation profile, **When** the admin clicks "Execute Remediation", **Then** the portal displays a confirmation dialog showing the number of rules, number of hosts, estimated execution time, and a warning that this will modify target host configurations
2. **Given** the admin confirms execution, **When** the portal launches the remediation, **Then** it invokes the mapped AAP workflow remediate node via the Gateway API with `--limit` set to the target hosts, `--tags` matching the selected rules, and `--extra-vars` containing any parameter overrides
3. **Given** remediation is in progress, **When** the admin views the compliance dashboard, **Then** they see real-time progress of the remediation job with per-host status updates
4. **Given** remediation completes successfully, **When** the workflow finishes, **Then** the portal automatically triggers a verification re-scan against the remediated hosts using the same compliance profile, and the new scan results are compared against the pre-remediation baseline
5. **Given** the verification re-scan completes, **When** the admin views the results, **Then** they see a before/after comparison showing which findings were resolved, which persist, and the overall compliance posture improvement

---

### User Story 6 - Admin Saves and Reuses Remediation Profiles (Priority: P2)

Remediation profiles encode institutional knowledge — which rules to enforce, which to skip, and what parameter values to use. Administrators need to save these profiles as named, reusable artifacts so that remediation decisions made during one scan cycle carry forward to future scans without repeating the triage process.

**Why this priority**: Profile reuse is critical for operational efficiency in environments with regular compliance scan cycles (monthly, quarterly). Without persistence, administrators waste time re-making the same decisions every cycle and risk inconsistent remediation across scan periods.

**Independent Test**: Build a remediation profile, save it with a name and description, run a new scan, apply the saved profile to the new findings, and verify the same rule selections and parameter overrides are applied without manual re-entry.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a completed remediation profile, **When** the admin clicks "Save Profile", **Then** they are prompted for a profile name, description, and optional tags, and the profile is persisted to the compliance database
2. **Given** saved profiles exist, **When** the admin navigates to Compliance > Profiles, **Then** they see a list of saved profiles with name, compliance standard, creation date, last used date, and number of rules configured
3. **Given** a new scan has completed with findings, **When** the admin clicks "Apply Profile" and selects a saved profile, **Then** the profile builder pre-populates with the saved selections (rule toggles, parameter overrides, scope settings) and highlights any new findings not covered by the saved profile
4. **Given** a saved profile applied to new findings, **When** new rules appear that were not in the original profile, **Then** those new rules are flagged as "Unreviewed" and default to included, requiring explicit admin decision

---

### User Story 7 - Admin Exports Findings for Auditors (Priority: P2)

Security officers and compliance auditors need to export scan findings and remediation status in standard formats (CSV, JSON) for integration with external audit workflows, GRC platforms, and compliance reporting tools. Exports must include sufficient detail to satisfy auditor evidence requirements.

**Why this priority**: External audit integration is a common enterprise requirement but does not block the core scan-review-remediate workflow. Auditors can initially review findings in the portal UI, with export capability added to streamline recurring audit cycles.

**Independent Test**: Complete a scan, navigate to findings, click "Export", select CSV format, and verify the downloaded file contains all findings with rule ID, title, severity, host-level pass/fail status, actual values, and timestamps.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a completed scan with findings, **When** the admin clicks "Export Findings", **Then** they see format options (CSV, JSON) and scope options (all findings, filtered findings, selected findings only)
2. **Given** CSV export selected, **When** the admin clicks "Download", **Then** a CSV file is generated containing columns for: scan ID, scan date, rule ID, rule title, severity (CAT I/II/III), host, compliance status, actual value, expected value, and remediation status
3. **Given** JSON export selected, **When** the admin clicks "Download", **Then** a JSON file is generated with a structured schema including scan metadata, finding details, host-level results, and remediation profile associations
4. **Given** an export in either format, **When** the exported data is reviewed, **Then** it contains no secrets, tokens, or internal infrastructure details beyond hostname and compliance status

---

### User Story 8 - Event-Driven Compliance Scan Triggered by Infrastructure Change (Priority: P3)

Automation architects need infrastructure changes (new host provisioned, configuration drift detected, patch applied) to automatically trigger compliance scans via Event-Driven Ansible (EDA). When a relevant event occurs, an EDA rulebook should trigger the compliance scan workflow using a predefined compliance profile, with results flowing into the same findings database and dashboard as manually launched scans.

**Why this priority**: Event-driven compliance is a strategic differentiator over competitors (neither Puppet SCE nor Chef Compliance offer event-triggered scanning), but it depends on EDA integration maturity and is not required for the core manual workflow. This extends the compliance pipeline from periodic to continuous.

**Independent Test**: Configure an EDA rulebook that triggers on a webhook event, fire the webhook to simulate an infrastructure change, and verify that a compliance scan is automatically launched against the affected hosts with findings appearing in the compliance dashboard.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a registered compliance cartridge and a configured EDA rulebook, **When** an infrastructure change event is received by EDA (e.g., new host added to inventory, configuration drift webhook), **Then** EDA triggers the compliance scan workflow via the AAP Gateway API using the mapped cartridge
2. **Given** an event-driven scan is triggered, **When** the scan completes, **Then** the findings are stored in the same compliance database and appear in the same dashboard as manually launched scans, with the trigger source marked as "event-driven" rather than "manual"
3. **Given** continuous event-driven scanning is active, **When** multiple events arrive within a configurable cooldown window (e.g., 5 minutes), **Then** they are batched into a single scan rather than triggering redundant concurrent scans
4. **Given** event-driven scanning, **When** a scan finds CAT I (critical) failures, **Then** the portal can optionally trigger an automatic remediation using a saved remediation profile if the cartridge is configured for auto-remediation mode

---

### Edge Cases

- **Cartridge with deleted EE**: What happens when the EE referenced by a registered cartridge is deleted from AAP? The cartridge status indicator shows "EE unavailable", scan launches using that cartridge are blocked with a clear error message, and the admin is directed to update the cartridge mapping
- **Scan against empty inventory**: What happens when a scan is launched against an inventory with zero reachable hosts? The AAP workflow completes with zero findings, the portal displays "No hosts reachable" with the inventory name, and the scan is recorded in history with a "no results" status
- **Partial host failures**: What happens when a scan succeeds on 18 of 20 hosts but 2 hosts are unreachable? Findings are stored for the 18 successful hosts, the 2 unreachable hosts are listed with "unreachable" status, and the scan is marked "completed with warnings"
- **Concurrent scans same hosts**: What happens when two scans target overlapping hosts simultaneously? Both scans proceed independently (AAP handles job isolation), but the portal shows a warning on the second scan launch and stores findings from both scans with distinct scan IDs and timestamps
- **Profile applied to different standard**: What happens when a saved STIG profile is applied to CIS scan findings? The portal warns that the profile was built for a different compliance standard, shows unmatched rules as "Not applicable", and allows the admin to proceed with only the matching rules
- **Remediation with no failing hosts**: What happens when an admin tries to execute a remediation profile but all hosts now pass? The portal shows "No remediation needed — all targeted hosts are compliant" and logs the no-op execution for audit purposes
- **Export of large result sets**: What happens when exporting findings from a scan of 10,000+ hosts? Export is processed asynchronously with a download link provided when complete, with a maximum export size of 100MB
- **EDA event flood**: What happens when EDA receives hundreds of events per minute? The cooldown window batches events, a maximum concurrent scan limit prevents resource exhaustion, and events exceeding the limit are queued with FIFO ordering

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Platform administrators can register a compliance cartridge (EE + workflow mapping) and launch a scan from the portal in under 5 minutes without AAP Controller UI access
- **SC-002**: Scan findings display per-host, per-rule detail including actual observed values — not just aggregate pass/fail percentages
- **SC-003**: Remediation profile builder supports selective rule toggling, parameter overrides, and scope selection (failed-only vs standardize-all) for individual rules
- **SC-004**: Remediation execution uses dynamic host grouping, generating no more than N jobs for N distinct remediation configurations regardless of host count (scales to 20,000+ hosts without creating per-host jobs)
- **SC-005**: Saved remediation profiles can be applied to new scan results, pre-populating prior decisions and flagging new unreviewed rules
- **SC-006**: Scan findings are exportable in CSV and JSON formats with per-host detail suitable for auditor evidence packages
- **SC-007**: Verification re-scan runs automatically after remediation and provides before/after compliance posture comparison
- **SC-008**: Event-driven scans triggered via EDA produce findings indistinguishable from manual scans in the portal dashboard
- **SC-009**: All AAP API calls route through the Gateway URL using per-user tokens — zero direct Controller API calls from the portal
- **SC-010**: Compliance data (findings, profiles, posture history) persists in Backstage PostgreSQL and survives portal restarts with clean removal via down migrations

## Assumptions

- AAP 2.6+ is deployed and accessible via the AAP Gateway URL with OAuth2 authentication configured
- The Ansible Portal (RHDH/Backstage) is the frontend hosting environment with the compliance plugin installed as a dynamic plugin
- ComplianceAsCode remediation content (`scap-security-guide` RPM) is available in the Execution Environment and provides the remediation playbooks — the compliance plugin does not author remediation content
- Compliance cartridges use the collection + EE profile model: an Ansible collection (e.g., `security.compliance_rhel9_stig`) ships an EE profile definition, and the EE Builder constructs the EE from it
- AAP workflow templates for compliance pipelines (gather, evaluate, remediate nodes) are pre-created in the Controller before cartridge registration
- The AAP Gateway is the sole API entry point — direct Controller API access is not used (aligns with AAP 2.7+ architecture)
- Backstage PostgreSQL is available for compliance data persistence (findings, profiles, posture history, cartridge registry)
- Per-user AAP tokens are available via the `x-aap-token` header pattern established by the Portal authentication flow
- OpenSCAP is the Tier 1 scanner for RHEL STIG/CIS benchmarks; the architecture supports pluggable Tier 2 (BYOS: Qualys, Tenable) and Tier 3 (hybrid) scanners via additional cartridge types
- EDA integration (User Story 8) depends on EDA Server being deployed and configured with appropriate rulebooks — this is a stretch goal
- The compliance plugin operates as a scanner orchestrator, not a scanner — it invokes existing scanning tools through AAP workflows rather than performing scans directly
