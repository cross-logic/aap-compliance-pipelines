# Specification Quality Checklist: Compliance Pipelines

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: PASS

All quality criteria met:

- 8 prioritized user stories (P1: cartridge registration, scan launch, findings review, profile builder; P2: remediation execution, profile reuse, export; P3: event-driven scanning)
- 32 functional requirements organized by category (compliance profile registration, scan execution, findings review, remediation builder, remediation execution, remediation management, export, event-driven integration, security/access control)
- 8 edge cases identified with clear expected behaviors (deleted EE, empty inventory, partial host failures, concurrent scans, profile/standard mismatch, no-op remediation, large exports, event floods)
- 10 measurable success criteria covering scan speed, host-level detail, profile builder capabilities, scalability, export formats, and security constraints
- 5 key entities defined with attributes (Compliance Profile, Scan, Finding, Remediation, Posture Record)
- Comprehensive assumptions section covering AAP version, scanner model, content consumption, Gateway API routing, and EDA dependency
- Spec focuses on WHAT users need (scan, review, remediate, verify compliance posture) and WHY (regulatory requirements, operational efficiency, competitive differentiation), not HOW to implement
- Host-level remediation UX is clearly specified as the core differentiator (per-host actual values, selective rule toggles, "failed only" vs "standardize all" scope, parameter overrides, dynamic host grouping for scale)

**Ready for**: Implementation planning and task breakdown
